# SantasAbduction
My first game made in Unity, scripts written in C#. 
This is a top down stealth game in which the object of each level is to sneak Santa away from his alien captures! 
I drew the tiles and tilemaps myself using Aseprite.
The app includes interstitial and rewarded ads (ad IDâ€™s etc were removed for posting here)
The app is available for both Android and iOS
